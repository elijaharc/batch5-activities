<!-- Using code from the previous Playing Cards activity: 1. Implement a "Deal -->
<!-- Card" button where it pops a card from the deck and shows its name and symbol.
This button must disable according to the cards left in the deck. 2. Implement a
"Remaining Cards" view where it should see the number of remaining cards in the
deck 3. Implement a "Draw History" function where you can see the history of the
cards dealt 4. Implement "Previous" and "Next" buttons. That will show the past
cards dealt. These buttons must enabled according to the draw history's length
5. Implement a "Reshuffle Deck" button that would reshuffle the deck and reset
the history. The design and representation and responsiveness of the cards in
the DOM is up to your creativity and imagination. You may use array built-in
methods. -->
