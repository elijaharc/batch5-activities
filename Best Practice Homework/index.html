      <h1>"Avoid using inline styles and javascript"</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        A best practice concept that really stood out to me was the practice
        that we should use an external CSS or Javascript sheet instead of adding
        it inline. This is to help organize all the edits and changes we do to
        our webpage. While you can do it inline, it won’t be the best way to do
        it because once you’re handling hundreds of lines of code, it can be so
        easy to lose track of all the stylings and edits you’ve done.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        To help prevent this, using an external sheet will put all the CSS
        changes and Javascript codes in a separate and organized file that you
        can easily refer to anytime, even if you’re working with many lines of
        code.
